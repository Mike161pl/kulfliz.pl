**Commercial project**
This is my next commercial project in which I used my previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and even some PHP code to handle the form. In addition, I created the entire mockup for the client's website.

## üí≠ What I learned
Thanks to this project, I learned how to use the form on the server side. While writing the project, I practiced the things I learned and noticed that what used to be difficult for me is now easier and faster. This gives me the desire to take on new challenges and projects.
